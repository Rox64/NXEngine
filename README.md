This is iOS port of the complete open-source clone/rewrite of Doukutsu Monogatari (also known as Cave Story) originally created by rogueeve (kty@lavabit.com).

Demonstration: http://youtu.be/jH2xsjXx28U

Game has been tested on jailbroken iPhone 4S (iOS 5.1.1) and non-jailbroken iPad 2 (iOS 5.1.1).

# How to install development build:

tl;dr video tutorial http://youtu.be/scSGqTP4AFs

0. You need __jailbroken__ device with Cydia. I have no apple developer profile so I unable to build package for non-jailbroken devices.
1. Open Cydia.
2. Go to "Manage" - "Sources"
3. Press "Edit" - "Add"
4. Enter link to Cydia source: http://pilin.github.com/NXEngine-iOS/repo/
5. New source "NXEngine-iOS dev" must appear. Install package from it.

# Biggest changes:
- Original engine has been transfered to SDL2.
- Render system has been changed to use hardware accelerated SLD2 API.
- Graphics resolution will be automatically selected in runtime. In theory, it must correctly run on all iPad's and iPhones version >= 4.
- Original engine has been changed to support separate file locations for game resources (read-only), save files (read-write, persistent) and cache files (read-write, temporary).
- Primitive virtual joypad has been implemented.
- Touch control of in-game buttons, dialogs, e.t.c.
