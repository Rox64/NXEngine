From v0.6.1 to v0.7:

* Sufficient render speed-up.

  There were some very slow levels like Waterway or room in Labyrinth, where Booster falls. Now those levels work at normal speed.

* Fixed #8: Extra-slow mini-map rendering

* Fixed slowdown on fade-out and fade-in between levels

* Fixed #32: Crash on music change
