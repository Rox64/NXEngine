From v0.7 to v0.8:

* Fixed #35: Micro-freezes every few seconds

	Now music is generated in separate thread, so, there will be no game freeze on each new music piece.

* Fixed #24: Wrong collision detection

	Now it should be impossible to fly into the slope and do some other weird things.

* Fixed #36: "Unsafe" spikes

	Now spikes behave like in an original game. And "Last Cave" should be little bit easier now.

	Text and portraits in textboxes now rendered correctly.

* Fixed #34: Glitching clouds on "Outer Wall", "Balcony", e.t.c
